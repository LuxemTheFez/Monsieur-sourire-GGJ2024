# The Plot :
    The Big Bad Boss trapped us ! 

    We need to make him laugh to reveal is weakpoint and throw poop at it!

    We'll have to fight some baddies and loot some funny stuff to make a scene that'll make him have fun

    With the help of the Catapoop, we'll be able to gather some poop and launch it at Mr. Sourire!
